####Link-State Routing
Every node has **global knowledge** of the entire topology and does **local route computation** using **Djikstra's Algorithm**.

####Distance-Vector Routing
Every node has **local knowledge** about its neighbors and does **global route computation** using **Bellman-Ford's Algorithm**.
