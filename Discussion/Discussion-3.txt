####BGP
- Protocol for inter-domain routing
- Designed for policy and privacy
- Why not distance-vector?
	- Shortest path may not be policy compliant
	- and policies vary across domains
- Why not link-state?
	- Everybody knows everything - privacy goes for a toss
- **Enter Path Vector**

####Realtionships
- Provider -> Customer
- Peer <-> Peer

#####It's all about the money!
- Customer pays provider
- Peers don't pay each other
	- Assume equal flow both ways
- Routing policies try to minimize payment

#####Typical Export Policy
Destination prefix advertised by | Export route to
--- | ---
Customer | Everyone (providers, peers, other customers)
Peer | Customers
Provider | Customers

	We'll refer to these as the "Gao-Rexford" rules (capture common -- but not required! - practice!)

####Gao-Rexford
- With Gao-Rexford, the AS policy graph is a DAG and routes are "valley free"

####Packets flow where money flows
- Route Selection
	- Preference order: Customer > Peer > Provider
- Route Export Policy
	- Peers provide transit between their customers
	- Peers do not provide transit to each other
