####Nodal Delay
Processing + Queuing 

#####Processing Delay
- Processing on reception
- Examine header and determine where to send
- Error checking (maybe)
#####Queuing Delay
- Time packet spends in buffer/queue
- Only when arrival rate > service rate
- Especially significant when packet arrivals are bursty
#####Transmission Delay
- Time taken to push data onto link
- Measured
	- from when first bit of data pushed onto link
	- until last bit of data is pushed onto the link
- Limited by the link **bandwidth**
#####Propagation Delay
- Time taken by data to transverse link
- Limited by the speed of light


####Beyond Nodal Delays
- End-to-End Delay
	- Just the sum of the nodal delays along a path
- Round Trip Time (RTT)
	- 2x: cue send & response

####Virtual Circuits
- Covered more in section 4.2 of text
- Circuit Establishment
	- Source sends a setup packet to switches along path/circuit toward destination
	- Switches along path set up cennection
	- At end of path, desitnation sends confirmation back
- Transfer
	- Data send along path/circuit
	- Note: Data sent along established circuit is cut-through!
		- cut-through: the switch starts forwarding a packet before the whole packet has been received
	- Question: What is the transmission rate of the circuit?
- Circuit Teardown
	- Source sends teardown packet along path
	- Destination sends confirmation back
