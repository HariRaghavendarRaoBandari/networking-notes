####What is Networking about?
- **End-system**: A device that uses the internet to communicate
	- E.g. linux server, windows PC, MAC laptop, iPad, smartphone, car navigator, heart pacemaker
- **Switch**: Helps the end-system communicate
- **Link**: Connects end-systems to switches and switches to other switches
- **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**:
	- E.g. Cable company, phone company, university net
- **Packet**: A set of formatted bits
- **Path**: The sequence of links and switches through which packets travel from their origin to their destination
- **Protocol**: A set of rules on how to communicate

####A few defining characteristics of the Internet
<br>
#####A federated system
- The Internet interconnects different networks (> 18,000 ISPs)
- One common protocol -- the "Internet Protocol (IP)" - between users and the network and between networks
- Interoperability is the Internet's most important goal
- Leads to a constant tussle between business and technical factors
	- competing ISPs must cooperate to serve their customers
	- practical realities of incentives, economics and real-world trust determine physical topology and path selection
	- a common protocol is great for interoperability ... but complicates innovation

#####Tremendous scale
<br>
#####Enormous diversity and dynamic range
- Communication latency: microsends to seconds (10^6)
- Bandwidth: 1KBits / second to 100 Gigabits/second (10^7)
- Packet loss: 0-90%
- Technology: optical, wireless, satellite, copper
- Endpoint devices, sensors, cell phones, datacenters
- Applications: Skype, live video, gaming, remote medicine
- Users: the governing, governed, operators, selfish, **malicious**, naive, savvy, embarrassed, paranoid, ...

#####Constant Evolution
<br>
#####Asynchronous Operation
- Fundamental constraint: speed of light

#####Prone to Failure
- To send a message, all components along a path must function correctly
	- Software, modem, wireless access point, firewall, links, network interface cards, switches, ...
	- Including **human operators**

#####An Engineered System
- Constrained by limits of available technology
	- Link bandwidths
	- Switch port counts
	- Bit error rates
	- Cost

####What do we know?
- The early Internet pioneers came up with a solution that was successful beyond all imagining
- Several enduring **architectural principles and practices** emerged from their work
- But it is just one design
- And numerous cracks have emerged over time
	- want to diagnose problems but federation hides inner workings
	- want to block unwanted traffic but the network doesn't authenticate
	- cant optimize for different applications or customers
	- upgrading protocols is deeply painful
	- As have new requirements
		- COMPLETE

####Architectural principles
- Decentralization [lectures: all]
- Packets [lecture 2]
- Statistical multiplexing [lecture 2]
- Best effort service [lecture 3]
- The "end to end" design principle [lectures 8+]
- "Layered" decomposition [lectures: all]
- IP as "narrow waist" interface [lecture 8]

####Summary
- The Internet offers us a lesson on how to reason through the design of a complex system
	- What are our goals and constraints?
	- What's the right prioritization of goals?
	- How do we decompose a problem?
	- Who does what? How?
	- What are the tradeoffs between design options?
- In short: a lesson in how to **architect** a system

####Network Architecture
- More about thinking rigorously than doing rigorous math
- More about understanding tradeoffs than running benchmarks
- More about practicality than optimality
- **Done right, can be a powerful thing**

####What CS168 will teach me
- **How** the Internet works
- **Why** it works the way it does
- How to **reason** through a complicated (networking) design problem

###Workload
- Three projects
- Three homeworks
- One midterm
- Final
