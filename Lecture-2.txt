- How is it shared?
- How do we evaluate a network?

---

####Phone company
	Home PC --> [ DSL modem ] --> Phoneline --> [ Central Office: DSLAM --> Switch] --> ...
					|-> telephone									|-> telephone network
					
					
#####Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
- Twisted pair copper
- 3 separate channels
	- downstream data channel
	- upstream data channel
	- 2-way phone channel
- up to 25 Mbps downstream
- up to 2.5 Mbps upstream

#####Why phone lines?
- They are everywhere

####Cable company
	Home PC --> [ cable modem ] --> copper ---> O --> fiber --> [ Cable head end: CMTS --> Switch] --> ...
	
#####Cable
- Coaxial copper & fiber
- up to 42.8 Mbps downstream
- up to 30.7 Mbps upstream
- Shared network

####University net
	Workstation --> Ethernet cable ---> "local" switch --> aggregate switch" --> ...

###How is it shared?

- How do we scale a network to many end-systems?
- Switched networks enable efficient scaling!
- Two approaches to sharing
	- Reservation
	- On-demand
- Switching on-demand exploits **statistical multiplexing** better than reservations
	- Sharing using the statistics of demand
	- Good for bursty traffic (average << peak demand)
	- Similar to insurance, with the same failure mode

####Statistical multiplexing is a recurrent theme in computer science
- Phone network rather than dedicated lines
	- ancient history
- Packet switching rather than circuits
	- today's lecture
- Cloud computing
	- shared vs. dedicated machines

####Two approaches to sharing

#####Packet Switching
- Packets treated on demand
- Admission control: **per packet**

#####Circuit Switching
- Resources reserved per active "connection"
- Admission control: **per connection**

#####A hybrid: virtual circuits
- Emulating "circuit" switching with packets... check textbook!

####Circuit Switching
	Reservation establishes a "circuit" within a switch
1. **src** sends a reservation request to **dst**
2. Switches "establish a circuit"
3. **src** starts sending data
4. **src** sends a teardown circuit message

#####Many kinds of "circuits"
- Time division multiplexing (**TDM**)
	- Divide time in **time slots**
	- Separate time slots per circuit
- Frequency division multiplexing (**FDM**)
	- Divide frequency spectrum in **frequency bands**
	- Separate frequency band per circuit

#####Timing in Circuit Switching
1. Circuit establishment
2. Data transfer
3. Circuit teardown

#####Inefficiencies in Circuit Switching
- Case 1: Multiple data transfers with standby periods in-between with no data transmission
	- Unused circuit
- Case 2: Really small data transfer
	- Circuit establishment and teardown takes more time than data transfer, too much work for such a little transmission
- Circuit switching doesn't "route around trouble" if a switch fails

#####Evaluation of Circuit Switching
- Pros
	- Predictable performance
	- Simple/fast switching (once circuit established)
- Cons
	- Complexity of circuits setup/teardown
	- Inefficient when traffic is bursty
	- Circuit setup adds delay
	- Switch fails -> its circuit(s) fails

####Packet Switching
- Each packet contains destination (**dst**)
- Each packet treated independently
- With buffers to absorb transient overloads

#####Evaluation of Packet Switching
- Pros
	- Efficient use of network resources
	- Simpler to implement
	- Robust: can "route around trouble"
- Cons
	- Unpredictable performance
	- Requires buffer management and congestion control
