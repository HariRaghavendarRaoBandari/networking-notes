####Interdomain Routing: Setup
- Destinations are IP prefixes (12.0.0.0/8)
- Nodes are Autonomous Systems (ASes)
	- Internals of each AS are hidden
- Links represent both physical links and business relationships
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the Interdomain routing protocol
	- Implemented by AS border routers

####BGP: Basic Idea
- An AS advertises its best routes to one or more IP prefixes
- Each AS selects the "best" route it hears advertises for a prefix
- Loop

####BGP inspired by Distance Vector
- Per-destination route advertisements
- No global sharing of network topology information
- Iterative and distributed convergence on paths
- **With four crucial differences!**

####Differences between BGP and DV

#####1) Not picking shortest path routes
- BGP selects the best route based on policy, not shortest distance (least cost)

#####2) Path vector routing
- Key idea: advertise the entire path
	- Distance vector: send **distance metric** per destination
	- Path vector: send the **entire path** for each destination
- Benefits
	- Loop avoidance is easy

#####3) Selective route advertisement
- For policy reasons, an AS may choose not to advertise a route to a destination
- Hence, reachability is not guaranteed even if graph is connected

#####4) BGP may aggregate routes
- For scalability, BGP may aggregate routes for different prefixes

####Policy policy
#####Policy imposed in how routes are selected and exported
- **Selection**: Which path to use?
	- Controls whether/how traffic leaves the network
- **Export**: Which path to advertise?
	- Controls whether/how traffic enters the network

#####Typical Selection Policy
- In decreasing order of priority
	- make/save money (send to customer > peer > provider)
	- maximize performance (smallest AS path length)
	- minimize use of my network bandwidth ("hot potato")
	- ...

#####Typical Export Policy

Destination prefix advertised by | Export route to
--- | ---
Customer | Everyone (providers, peers, other customers)
Peer | Customers
Provider | Customers

	We'll refer to these as the "Gao-Rexford" rules (capture common -- but not required! -- practice!)
	
#####Gao-Rexford
- With Gao-Rexford, the AS policy graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) and routes are "valley free"

---

####BGP protocol details

#####Who speaks BGP?
	- Border routers at an Autonomous System

#####What does "speak BGP" mean?
- Implement the BGP protocol standard
- Specifies what messages to exchange with other BGP "speakers"
	- message types (e.g., route advertisements, updates)
	- message syntax
- And how to process these messages
	- e.g., "when you receive a BGP update, do..."
	- follows BGP state machine in the protocol spec + policy decisions, etc.

#####BGP "sessions"
- A border router speaks BGP with border routers in other ASes
- A border router speaks BGP with other (interior and border) routers in its own AS

#####Types of BGP
- **eBGP**: BGP sessions between border routers in **different** ASes
	- Learn routes to external destinations
- **iBGP**: BGP sessions between border routers and other routers within the **same** AS
	- Distributed externally learned routes internally
- **IGP**: "Interior Gateway Protocol" = Intradomain routing protocol
	- provide internal reachability
	- e.g., OSPF, RIP

#####Some border routers don't need BGP
- Customer that connects to a single upstream ISP
	- The ISP can advertise prefixes into BGP on behalf of customer
	- ... and the customer can simply default-route to the ISP

#####Putting the pieces together
1. Provide internal reachability (IGP)
2. Learn routes to external destinations (eBGP)
3. Distribute externally learned routes internally (iBGP)
4. Travel shortest path to egress (IGP)

#####Basic Messages in BGP
- Open
	- Establishes BGP session
	- BGP uses TCP
- Notification
	- Report unusual conditions
- Update
	- Inform neighbor of new routes
	- Inform neighbor of old routes that become inactive
- Keepalive
	- Inform neighbor that connection is still viable

####Route Updates
- Format <IP prefix: route attributes>
	- attributes describe properties of the route
- Two kinds of updates
	- **announcements**: new routes or changes to existing routes
	- **withdrawal**: remove routes that no longer exist

####Route Attributes
- Routes are described using attributes
	- Used in route selection/export decisions
- Some attributes are local
	- i.e., private within an AS, not included in announcements
- Some attributes are propagated with eBGP route announcements
- There are many standardized attributes in BGP

#####Attributes
- ASPATH
	- Carried in route announcements
	- Vector that lists all the ASes a route advertisement (in reverse order)
- LOCAL PREF
	- "Local Preference"
	- Used to choose between different AS paths
	- The higher the value the more preferred
	- Local to an AS; carried only in iBGP messages
- MED
	- "Multi-Exit Discriminator"
	- Used when ASes are interconnected via 2 or more links to specify how close a prefix is to the link it is announced on
	- Lower is better
	- AS announcing prefix sets MED
	- AS receiving prefix (optionally!) uses MED to select link
- IGP cost
	- Used for hot-potato routing
		- Each router selects the closest egress point based on the path cost in intra-domain protocol

#####BGP UPDATE Processing
1. Apply Import Policies
2. Best Route Selection
3. Best Route Table -> IP Forwarding Table (Data plane)
4. Apply Export Policies

####BGP Issues
- Reachability
	- In normal routing, if graph is connected then reachability is assured
	- With policy routing, this does not always hold
- Security
	- An AS can claim to serve a prefix that they don't have a route to (blackholing traffic)
		- Problem not specific to policy or path vector
		- Important because of AS autonomy
		- Fixable: make ASes "prove" they have a path
	- Note: AS may forward packets along a route different from what is advertised
		- Tell customers about fictitious short path...
		- Much harder to fix!
- Convergence
	- Result: If all AS policies follow "Gao-Rexford" rules, BGP is guaranteed to converge (safety)
	- For arbitrary policies, BGP may fail to converge!
